Below is a project that showcase my work in strategic marketing, campaign development, and brand management. The example I highlighted shows how I apply leadership, data-informed decision making, and creative direction to drive marketing success.

## Analyzing SEO Practices: Lululemon vs. Industry Competitors

In this project, I conducted a competitive SEO analysis comparing Lululemon with key industry players including Vuori and Athleta. The goal was to evaluate how effectively each brand structures its website content for search engine visibility and user engagement.

Using a reproducible R-based workflow, I scraped and analyzed key webpage types—such as Home, About, Sustainability, and Customer Service pages—to extract and compare title tags and heading structures. I then applied text mining techniques to identify high-frequency bi-grams and keyword patterns across each brand’s content.

This analysis revealed how each brand prioritizes messaging, which terms dominate their SEO strategy, and where Lululemon may be underutilizing high-impact keywords. The findings were visualized through comparative bar charts and word clouds, and summarized in a dashboard-ready report.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- **SEO Strategy & Competitive Benchmarking:** Identified keyword gaps and content structure differences across brands.
- **Text Mining & Web Scraping:** Built a reproducible R pipeline to extract and analyze HTML content.
- **Data Visualization:** Created comparative visuals to highlight SEO strengths and weaknesses.
- **Strategic Recommendations:** Delivered actionable insights to improve Lululemon’s content targeting and search visibility.

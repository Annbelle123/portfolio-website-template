# üõí About the Dataset

This dashboard is built using a sales dataset from Kaggle that captures **four years of transactions** from a global superstore. Each row represents a unique order, with details spanning **customer segments**, **order and shipping dates**, **shipping methods**, **product categories**, and **sales revenue**.

The dataset enables analysis of key business insights including:

-   **Sales trends over time**

-   **Product and category profitability**

-   **Customer behavior by segment**
